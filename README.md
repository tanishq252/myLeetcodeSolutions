# Leetcode solutions 👨‍💻

- As far as data structures and algorithms are concerned they are the most importatnt concepts to crack coding interviews
- Rather than just submitting my solutions I have made this repo to save them in a structured way so any beginner can have a look on these solutions and try to solve the quetsions
- I have used cpp and stl for most of the questions
- The solutions consist of my approach as well as the most optimized approach
