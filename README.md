# Leetcode solutions 👨‍💻

- As far as data structures and algorithms are concerned they are highly required to crack coding interviews for big tech companies.
- Rather than just submitting my solutions I have made this repo to save them in a structured way so any beginner can have a look on these solutions and try to solve the quetsions
- CPP and STL have been used for most of the questions
- The solutions consist of my approach as well as the most optimized approach
